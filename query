-- Write a query that only returns the email_address column
-- Join the tables together using the join_id column present in both tables
-- Column_1 needs to be divisible by 2 without creating a decimal number (or modulo)
-- column_2 needs to be smaller then column_1
-- Column_3 needs to end with a 1


SELECT email
FROM public.email_table a JOIN public.data_table b
ON a.join_id = b.join_id
WHERE column_1 % 2 = 0 and column_2 < column_1 and CAST(column_3 AS varchar) like '%1'
